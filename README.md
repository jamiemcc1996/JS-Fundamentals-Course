Fundamentals of JS

Welcome to this course on the JavaScript Fundamentals. I am too also learning the fundamentals of JS and I noq understand it a lot better and want to take my learning to the next level and be able to offer people a good resource to learn the fundamentals because it is hard to know where to start.

I started learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript at the start of lock down and it is something I do not want to give up on and if I can help people I will be happy but at the same time I will be able to not imitate JS code and be able to understand what is being written behind the scenes. If you also want to understand this language then I challenge you to follow on with this course and learn by actually coding.

I started off by making the mistake of watching videos on YouTube and thinking I would learn and not that I didn't pick things up but by actually getting involved in writing code and coming up with ideas for projects is the best way to grow and become better at programming.

I want to help people who are interested in learning and I think that this is very exciting because there is not really a limit to what you can do with programming and also I used to work in catering and I am trying to change career after having a brain injury and moving to Essex and also after lock down. I want to get a job either as an administrator or within I.T and everything so far that I have learned has been all by myself and it is really either sink or swim.

I hope you will enjoy this course and learn something.
